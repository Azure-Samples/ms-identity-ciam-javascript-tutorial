# Initialization of MSAL

Before you get started, please ensure you have completed all the [prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites).

## Initializing the PublicClientApplication object

In order to use MSAL Node, you need to instantiate a [PublicClientApplication](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/ref/classes/_azure_msal_node.publicclientapplication.html) object. We support and strongly recommend the use of [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636#section-6.2) (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for any PublicClientApplication. The usage pattern is demonstrated in the [PKCE Sample](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/auth-code-pkce).

```javascript
import * as msal from "@azure/msal-node";

const clientConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id",
        authority: "your_authority",
    },
};
const pca = new msal.PublicClientApplication(clientConfig);
```

## Configuration Basics

[Configuration](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/ref/modules/_azure_msal_node.html#configuration) options for node have `common` parameters and `specific` paremeters per authentication flow.

-   `client_id` is mandatory to initialize a public client application
-   `authority` defaults to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/` if the user does not set it during configuration

## Configure Authority

By default, MSAL is configured with the `common` tenant, which is used for multi-tenant applications and applications allowing personal accounts (not B2C).

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/",
    },
};
```

If your application audience is a single tenant, you must provide an authority with your tenant id like below:

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your_tenant_id}",
    },
};
```

If your application is using a separate OIDC-compliant authority like `"https://login.live.com"` or an IdentityServer, you will need to provide it in the `knownAuthorities` field and set your `protocolMode` to `"OIDC"`.

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "your_client_id",
        authority: "https://login.live.com",
        knownAuthorities: ["login.live.com"],
        protocolMode: "OIDC",
    },
};
```

For more information on authority, please refer to: [Authority in MSAL](../../msal-common/docs/authority.md).

## Advanced Configuration

[Configuration](https://azuread.github.io/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/ref/modules/_azure_msal_node.html#configuration) has more options which are documented [here](./configuration.md).

## Next Steps

Proceed to understand the public APIs provided by `msal-node` for acquiring tokens [here](request.md)
