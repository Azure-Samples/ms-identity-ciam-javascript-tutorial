# Securing MSAL Node app credentials with Azure Key Vault and Azure Managed Identity

> :warning: Before you start here, make sure you understand [Using certificate credentials with MSAL Node](./certificate-credentials.md).

## Using Azure Key Vault

Sensitive information should not be stored in source code. This section covers creating a key vault and accessing credentials from it using Azure SDKs. For an implementation, see the code sample: [auth-code-key-vault](../../../samples/msal-node-samples/auth-code-key-vault).

### Create a key vault and import certificates

First, create a key vault. To do so, follow the guide: [Quickstart: Create a key vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal#create-a-vault)

> :information_source: In addition to certificates, **Azure Key Vault** can also be used for storing secrets and other sensitive information such as database connection strings and etc.

Now you can import your certificate to Key Vault. **Azure Key Vault** expects certificates in either:

-   _.pem_ file format contains one or more X509 certificate files.
-   _.pfx_ file format is an archive file format for storing several cryptographic objects in a single file i.e. server certificate (issued for your domain), a matching private key, and may optionally include an intermediate CA.

> :bulb: If you don't have any certificates at hand, you can use Azure Key Vault to generate one for you. It will have the additional benefits of assigning a partner Certificate Authority and automating certificate rotation. For more information, see [Quickstart: Generate a certificate with Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/quick-create-portal)

We will combine our public and private key into a single _.pem_ file, and upload this file to Key Vault. For conversion, we will use **OpenSSL**. Type the following in a terminal:

```bash
cat example.crt example.key > example.pem
```

> Powershell users can use **cat** equivalent below:
>
> ```powershell
>    Get-Content example.crt, exampleDecrypted.key | Set-Content example.pem
> ```

This should give you `example.pem`. Next, **upload** this to Key Vault.

1. Navigate to your key vault on [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the Key Vault properties pages, select **Certificates**.
1. Click on **Generate/Import**.
1. On the **Create a certificate** screen choose the following values:
    - **Method of Certificate Creation**: Import.
    - **Certificate Name**: ExampleCertificate.
    - **Upload Certificate File**: select the certificate file from disk
    - **Password** : If you are uploading a password protected (i.e. _pass phrase_) certificate file, provide that password here. Otherwise, leave it blank. Once the certificate file is successfully imported, key vault will remove that password.
1. Click **Create**.

For alternative ways of importing, see: [Tutorial: Import a certificate in Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-import-certificate).

> :information_source: When you generate/import a certificate to Azure Key Vault Certificates, a corresponding private key is created automatically under Azure Key Vault Secrets. Later on, you can retrieve your private key from the **Secrets** blade.

### Get certificate from your vault in Node.js

Using [Azure Key Vault JavaScript SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/keyvault-certificates-readme?view=azure-node-latest), we can fetch the certificate we've uploaded in the previous step. During development, Azure **Key Vault JavaScript SDK** grabs the required access token from the local environment using VS Code's context, via [@azure/identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-node-latest) package. To do this, you'll need to be signed in to Azure.

First, [download and install](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) **Azure CLI**. This should add **Azure CLI** to system path. Re-launch VS Code and **Azure CLI** should be available in VS Code [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal). Then, type the following to sign-in:

```console
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
```

Once authenticated, [@azure/identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-node-latest) package can access the Azure Key Vault as shown below:

```JavaScript

// Initialize Azure SDKs
const credential = new identity.DefaultAzureCredential();
const certClient = new keyvaultCert.CertificateClient(KVUri, credential);
const secretClient = new keyvaultSecret.SecretClient(KVUri, credential);

async function main() {

    // Grab the certificate thumbprint
    const certResponse = await certClient.getCertificate(CERTIFICATE_NAME);
    const thumbprint = certResponse.properties.x509Thumbprint.toString('hex').toUpperCase();

    // When you upload a certificate to Key Vault, a "secret" containing your private key is automatically created
    const secretResponse = await secretClient.getSecret(CERTIFICATE_NAME);

    // secretResponse contains both public and private key, but we only need the private key
    const privateKey = secretResponse.value.split('-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n')[0]

    // Initialize msal and start the server
    msalApp(thumbprint, privateKey);
}

main();
```

For an implementation, see the code sample: [auth-code-key-vault](../../../samples/msal-node-samples/auth-code-key-vault).

> :information_source: Converting `PKCS12/PFX` to `PEM`
>
> In most circumstances, Azure Key Vault can export certificates and private keys in `pem` format (see: [Export stored certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/how-to-export-certificate?tabs=azure-cli#export-stored-certificates)), if **Content Type** was chosen as `pem` during certificate generation (see: [Create a certificate in Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates#create-a-certificate-in-key-vault)). If for some reason this is not the case, OpenSSL can be used for conversions. Please refer to [Certificates: converting pfx to pem](./certificate-credentials.md#optional-converting-pfx-to-pem).

## Using Azure Managed Identity

While developing on local environment you can use **Azure Key Vault JavaScript SDK**, you would use **Azure Managed Identity** service to access your key vault in production and deployment.

> Take a moment to get familiar with Managed Identity: [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-a-system-assigned-managed-identity-works-with-an-azure-vm)

### Deployment to App Service

For more information, visit: [How to use managed identities for App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?context=%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fmanaged-identities-azure-resources%2Fcontext%2Fmsi-context&tabs=dotnet)

#### Step 1: Deploy your files

1. In the **VS Code** activity bar, select the **Azure** logo to show the **Azure App Service** explorer. Select **Sign in to Azure...** and follow the instructions. Once signed in, the explorer should show the name of your **Azure** subscription(s).
2. On the **App Service** explorer section you will see an upward-facing arrow icon. Click on it publish your local files in the sample folder to **Azure App Services** (use "Browse" option if needed, and locate the right folder).
3. Choose a creation option based on the operating system to which you want to deploy. in this sample, we choose **Linux**.
4. Select a Node.js version when prompted. An **LTS** version is recommended.
5. Type a globally unique name for your web app and press Enter. The name must be unique across all of **Azure**. (e.g. `msal-node-webapp1`)
6. After you respond to all the prompts, **VS Code** shows the **Azure** resources that are being created for your app in its notification popup.
7. Select **Yes** when prompted to update your configuration to run `npm install` on the target Linux server.

### Step 2: Update your app's Redirect URI

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then find and select the web app that you have registered.
1. Navigate to the **Authentication** blade. There, in **Redirect URI** section, enter the following redirect URI: `https://msal-node-webapp1.azurewebsites.net/redirect`.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

### Integrate Managed Identity

#### Create a system-assigned identity

1. Navigate to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure App Service**.
1. Find and select the App Service you've created previously.
1. On App Service portal, select **Identity**.
1. Within the **System assigned** tab, switch **Status** to **On**. Click **Save**.

For more information, see [Add a system-assigned identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?tabs=dotnet#add-a-system-assigned-identity)

#### Grant access to Key Vault

Now that your app deployed to App Service has a managed identity, in this step you grant it access to your key vault.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search for your Key Vault.
1. Select **Overview** > **Access policies** blade on the left.
1. Click on **Add Access Policy** > **Certificate permissions** > **Get**
1. Click on **Add Access Policy** > **Secret permissions** > **Get**
1. Click on **Select Principal**, add your account and pre-created **system-assigned** identity.
1. Click on **OK** to add the new Access Policy, then click **Save** to save the Access Policy.

For more information, see [Use Key Vault from App Service with Azure Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/azure-samples/app-service-msi-keyvault-dotnet/keyvault-msi-appservice-sample/)

#### Add environment variables

Finally, you need to add environment variables to the App Service where you deployed your web app.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) , search for and select **App Service**, and then select your app.
1. Select **Configuration** blade on the left, then select **New Application Settings**.
1. Add the following variables (name-value):
    1. **REDIRECT_URI**: the redirect URI you've registered on Azure AD, e.g. `https://msal-node-webapp1.azurewebsites.net/redirect`
    1. **KEY_VAULT_NAME**: the name of the key vault you've created, e.g. `node-test-vault`
    1. **CERTIFICATE_NAME**: the name of the certificate you specified when importing it to key vault, e.g. `ExampleCert`

Wait for a few minutes for your changes on **App Service** to take effect. You should then be able to visit your published website and sign-in accordingly.
